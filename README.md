# JMusicBot - Mutiny Edit

A cross-platform Discord music bot with a clean interface, and that is easy to set up and run yourself!

## Custom Tweaks
  * Anyone can skip a song, there is no vote
  * The bot doesnt leave once its queue is finished (it'll wait until no one is left (unless you edit the configs) or until someone disconnects it)

## Setup
Please see the [Setup Page](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Setup) in the wiki of the original project to run this bot yourself!

## Editing
This bot (and the source code here) might not be easy to edit for inexperienced programmers. The main purpose of having the source public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, to allow others to understand how the bot works, and to allow those knowledgeable about java, JDA, and Discord bot development to contribute. There are many requirements and dependencies required to edit and compile it, and there will not be support provided for people looking to make changes on their own. Instead, consider making a feature request (see the above section). If you choose to make edits, please do so in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License.
